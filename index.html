                            <li>There was a bug that was causing my news command to fail and get stuck on that horrid yellow message! I don't want you waiting forever, and neither does my developer, so we hopefully fixed this!</li>
                            <li>The same goes for a bug that caused most music commands' error messages to improperly execute when using them in DM. This bug was hopefully squashed!</li>

                            <li>My "News" command looks way better than it did before! There's also quite a bit more going on under the hood than there was before for this command. Be sure to check it out!</li>
                            <li>My "Stop" command now has an alias of "Clear", and my "Changelog" command now has an aliases of "Update/Updates".</li>
                            <li>My "Play" command now has some fancy magic that will, when a song is playing but has been paused, resume the song instead of playing a new one. However, if I detect additional input (such as a song name) alongside the "Play" command, then I'll go ahead and add that song to the queue instead of resuming the paused song. The "Resume" and "Pause" commands still act like normal. I do this just for convenience!</li>
                            <li>I no longer get confused when both a Wolfram keyword and another keyword are detected. All other keywords have higher priority than the Wolfram keyword now.</li>

                            <li>Now instead of my skip command skipping the currently playing song, there's now a voting feature! You must receive enough votes from people in the voice channel to equal half of the amount of people in the voice channel in order to skip the song. You can't vote twice for a single song, and when you do vote, I'll send you a message confirming this and letting you know how many votes are left before the song is skipped, if there are any. This has been implimented to prevent abuse!</li>

                            <li>My silly developer was using a deprecated method of displaying my "Say my name and 'help' for help" line, so it failed to show up after a while. This has been fixed.</li>
                            <li>Instead of just displaying a confusing and disappointing error message whenever the Cleverbot API fails, I now utilize a random sentence generator to confuse you even more!</li>
                            <li>My loading feedback lines have grown in number and use! I now shuffle between multiple different "loading" lines, and the lines are used a bit more often than before.</li>
                            <li>The news command looks and feels the same to you, but it's hopefully a bit cleaner under the hood now.</li>

If you were trying to look up a fact-based question, then this information won't really matter to you, because what happened was that there was no data found for your question, so I went ahead and moved on to create a legitimate-sounding and humorous reply to your message. However, it seems that that has failed as well. I utilize the <a href="https://cleverbot.io" target="_blank">Cleverbot.io API</a> in order to create legitimate replies to your messages that don't contain any of my <a href="#usage">keywords</a>. However, the API goes offline a lot of the time, so you may see this error message popping up every now and again. Basically, all it means is that the Cleverbot.io API is offline, and there's not much else anybody can really do about it. I would like to use a different API if possible, but my developers told me that this is the only one that's free ;-;</p>
